From this presentation, I understood what parallelism is and its importance in various applications. For instance, as the presentation mentions Parallelism allows programs to take advantage of newer hardware. This consequently allows the program to become faster, scalable, and lag-free when waiting on single operations. From this presentation, I learned about the numerous problems that are encountered when implementing Parallelism in programs. These problems vary from memory consistency errors to evaluating the readiness in a program. I also learned about the current applications of parallel processing. Which to no surprise include large mathematical operations such as matrix operations.
